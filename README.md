NetBox is an IP address management (IPAM) and data center infrastructure management (DCIM) tool. 

We use Netbox to keep the information of IP allocating, server, network inventory and customer's service information. etc

NetBox runs as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL database.

We create the new forms for collecting customer's information base on services that we provide.
